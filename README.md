Urban Terror 4.2
================

This is the official repository to gather issues and suggestions about the game Urban Terror and specifically its version 4.2.

If you encounter a bug while using the official **UrTUpdater**, please report it [here](https://github.com/Barbatos/UrTUpdater) instead.

If you want to discuss about the future version of the game called **Urban Terror HD**, go [here](http://www.urbanterror.info/forums/forum/73-ue4-urban-terror-discussion/).

Rules
----------------

Please follow these basic rules in order to keep this place nice:

- Do not insult, troll or harass anyone
- Do a little research before posting a new issue to avoid duplication
- Do not "UP" the issues yourself, that won't make us process them faster
- Do not use ALL CAPS - we are not blind (yet)


Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Urban Terror 4.2, please first check that [a similar issue hasn't been opened yet](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror42/issues).

If your bug has not been reported yet, please provide us at least the following information:

- What platform you were using when having this bug (Windows, Linux, Mac OSX)
- The version of your platform (Windows 7, OSX 10.9...)
- A short and descriptive title of your bug
- A detailed description of your bug and **steps needed to reproduce it**
- A few screenshots if possible - they can easily be drag&drop'ed in your issue description
- A **complete** output of your game console

Please place huge logs using tools like [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) or [Gist](https://gist.github.com).

Feature Requests
----------------

While we always appreciate new feature requests, please note that we are heavily working on Urban Terror HD and we are probably not going to implement *huge* changes to Urban Terror 4.2 anymore.


**Thanks for your help!**
